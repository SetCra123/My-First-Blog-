# My-First-Blog
This is a repository for a website called My First Blog. In this website, I practice using an input form to add items to my local storage.

Once items are added to my local storage, by clicking the submit button, I created functionality to append these items to an external page called blog.html. These items are styles in individual cards and can be seen by clicking the text, "My Amazing World-Class Blog". 

# Features
There is a theme-switcher than can toggle between a night-mode and day-mode. The night mode has a button displayed as a sun and the day mode has a button displayed as a moon. When a user clicks this button, the theme is switched. There is also a spinning globe gif to accompany my tiile, "Amazing, World-Class Blog. 

# Techniques
This application is to showcase my skills in DOM Traversal. I wanted to practice using an input form to change or add elements to the page. A user can type in their name, a blog-title and a blog-comment. Once they click submit, the form clears itself and the user can add a new blog post. To see their posts, they can click on "Welcome to my Amazing World-Class Blog" link and they will be taken to a page that displays their blog-posts. 

The information from the input form is sent to local storage. Once it's in local storage, it is picked up and appended to the blog page using a JavaScritp function.
